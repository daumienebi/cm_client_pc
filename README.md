# Comic Management Desktop App

Comic management cliente (Desktop version) made with Java Swing. This project was a final school project to create a desktop app that communicates with a backend,
(Springboot in this case) to perform basic CRUD operations.

## Tools needed to set it up
By installing XAMPP, we basically have the necessary tools to get it running. You can choose to use other tools that can replicate the
same functionality.

- XAMPP
  - MYSQL (To manage the database)
  - Filezilla (To manage the FTP server used to upload the images of each comic)
  - Apache (to simulate a web server that will be used to retrieve the stored images)
